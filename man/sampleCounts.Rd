\title{The counts calculated by activityCounts and ActiLife based on included raw accelerometer data}
\format{
A \code{data.table} with nine columns: \describe{
 \item{Time}{Date and time}
 \item{activityCounts_x_counts}{counts calculated by \code{counts()} function in X direction}
 \item{activityCounts_y_counts}{counts calculated by \code{counts()} function in Y direction}
 \item{activityCounts_z_counts}{counts calculated by \code{counts()} function in Z direction}
 \item{ActiLife_x_counts}{counts calculated by ActiLife software in X direction}
 \item{ActiLife_y_counts}{counts calculated by ActiLife software in Y direction}
 \item{ActiLife_z_counts}{counts calculated by ActiLife software in Z direction}
 }
}
\usage{
sampleCounts
}
\description{
A simple \code{data.table} which its first row is measurement time. Then for each time step,
 counts are calculated by \code{activityCounts} and the ActiLife software. The counts are calculated based on
 included \code{sampleXYZ} dataset, which its sampling frequency is 100H.
