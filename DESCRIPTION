Description: ActiLife software generates activity counts from data collected by Actigraph accelerometers <https://s3.amazonaws.com/actigraphcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/26205758/ActiGraph-White-Paper_What-is-a-Count_.pdf>.
  Actigraph is one of the most common research-grade accelerometers. There is considerable research
  validating and developing algorithms for human activity using ActiLife counts. Unfortunately,
  ActiLife counts are proprietary and difficult to implement if researchers use different accelerometer brands.
  The code  creates ActiLife counts from raw acceleration data for different accelerometer brands and it is developed
  based on the study done by Brond and others (2017) <doi:10.1249/MSS.0000000000001344>.
